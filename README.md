# RF Signal Acquisition and Processing Experiments

Welcome to the RF Signal Acquisition and Processing repository! This project is designed for educational and exploratory purposes, offering a collection of experimental scripts that reflect my personal learning journey with radio frequency (RF) signals using Python and to a lesser degree Node.js. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional interested in RF technology, you'll find tools and experiments aimed at understanding and manipulating RF signals.

## Overview

This repository is a compilation of Python scripts and tools for acquiring and processing RF signals. These scripts are the result of my own learning process and are intended to facilitate hands-on exploration and deepen understanding of RF technology. The experiments included span various aspects of RF signal processing, from acquisition to data analysis, and serve as a learning resource.

## Features

- **RF Signal Acquisition**: Experimental tools to interface with RF hardware for capturing signals.
- **Signal Processing**: Algorithms and methods developed for analyzing and processing RF signals.
- **Visualization**: Functions for visualizing signal data to help in interpretation and analysis.
- **Educational Examples**: Sample scripts that showcase key concepts and techniques derived from my own experiments.

Happy experimenting with RF signals!
